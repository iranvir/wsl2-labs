# Purpose of this project
Setting up WSL2 is time consuming. The defaults are not what I want, the shell
is not correctly setup. Sometimes I want `root` to be default user. Sometimes I
want to create a different non-root user, and on and on....

I also want to override a lot of the defaults that Microsoft and Distro
maintainers provide. These scripts automate all of my preferences. This gives
me the freedom to experiment more freely within a WSL2 environment. If I break
something, it just takes one command to start again with a clean slate!
(I know we have Docker and Dockerfile, but where's the fun in that!)

I also want to learn more about PowerShell scripting and Windows Automation, so
if you see a better way of doing something that I am trying to do here, please
let me know either by raising a PR, starting an issue, or just write me an
email.

# How to use these scripts?

1. Clone this repo

2. Download the rootfs of the operating system you want, or if you cannot find
   the rootfs try using [this `docker export`
   method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/use-custom-distro) to
   generate it

3. Create a `rootfs/` directory at the root of this repo and put the compressed
   rootfs in there.

4. Review (or rewrite) `setup.sh` and `user.sh` to fit your needs. These are
   simple POSIX shell scripts and very easy to modify to do your bidding. It has
   some hard coded values like my GitHub username and Windows username so you
   may want to replace those.

5. Run `.\setup.ps1` with flags as described below:
    `.\setup.ps1 -Name NAME_FOR_YOUR_DISTRO -Rootfs PATH_TO_ROOTFS -UserName USER_NAME -EnableSystemd $false -IsAlpine $true`

    * If `-Rootfs` is the path to the compressed rootfs of the distro you want to
    install. If you don't have a compressed rootfs here is where you can get it:
        * Link for [RockyLinux 8 and
        9](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/interoperability/import_rocky_to_wsl/).
        Here, it is better to use the Base image rather than the Minimal Image.
        * Link for [Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 and
        24.04](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/wsl/)
        * Link for [Alpine Rootfs](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/). You would
        want the "Mini Root Filesystem" labeled "x86_64"

    * Set `-Name` to whatever you want to call that particular WSL2 instance. Could
    be a project name or whatever.

    * Supply `-UserName` which will be your primary Unix user within this WSL2
    instance. If this option is left out, you will drop in directly as root user.
    If you supply a username, it will automatically become a sudo user without
    any password. The user can change this later in the settings.  

    * `-IsAlpine` is just a special case check for Alpine Linux since it doesn't
    support `useradd` command and also doesn't support systemd (kinda). Default
    is false. Set `-IsAlpine = $true` if you are using it.

    * `-EnableSystemd = $false` flag disables systemd and you only use WSL2's init
    and that's it. The default is `$true` which starts systemd and dependant
    services.

# Future Plans
1. Will whip up a script to take a snapshot of a distro and back it up.
